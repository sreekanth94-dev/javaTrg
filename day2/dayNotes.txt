Opps features:

Encapsulation :provides security to the data
Inheritance : Resuable feature
Polymorphism : many forms

Encapsulation:-
Access to members of class can be restricted by access specifires like 
* Private
* protected 



Notes:
Referance variables must have to be intilize
Best practice is using of contructers to init values to data members
By default all attributes and functions have public access



Contructers:

* contructers are the special methods which have the same class as method name 
* which are used to intit values to data members
* these methods dont have return types

Types of contructers:

* Default contructers(Zero arguments)
* Parameterized contructers(with n arguments)

Default contructers:

we can say a contructer which dont take any arguments 

when object is created ,compiler performs two things 
* allocating memory for object
* calling appropriate contructer



How methods are going to diff data members of individual objects?

this => this is a variable which points to the obj through which the method is called
